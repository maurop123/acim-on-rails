# acim-on-rails

This super simple website is one button on one page. The one button generates a link to one of the 4 video audiobooks of A Course In Miracles, starting at a random location within the video. In effect it's like opening the book to a random page and putting your finger down somewhere with you eyes closed, and then read the mystery passage and see how it speaks to you. (i.e. bibliomancy)

## Gotcha

You may get an Oops screen from Youtube soon as the new tab opens up after pressing the button. You can refresh the YouTube page and it should work.


## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/maurop123/acim-on-rails.git
  cd acim-on-rails
```

2. **Setup the Application:**
```sh
  ./bin/setup
```
This script will install gem dependencies, create and migrate the database, and perform other necessary setup tasks.

3. **Start the Development Server:**
```sh
  ./bin/dev
```
This script will start the Rails development server, and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000
