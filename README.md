## Deprecated

This site was in part an opportunity to learn Rails. Given it's low requirements, I rewrote it as a webpage. You can find it at:
https://maurop123.github.io/acim-randomizer

## Description

This super simple website is one button on one page. The one button generates a link to one of the 4 video audiobooks of A Course In Miracles, starting at a random location within the video. In effect it's like opening the book to a random page and putting your finger down somewhere with you eyes closed, and then read the mystery passage and see how it speaks to you. (i.e. bibliomancy)


## Gotcha

You may get an Oops screen from Youtube soon as the new tab opens up after pressing the button. You can refresh the YouTube page and it should work.
